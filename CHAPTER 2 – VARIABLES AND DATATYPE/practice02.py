# CHAPTER 2 – PRACTICE SET 

# 1. Write a python program to add two numbers. 
# a=int(input( "1st number: "))
# # print("Enter the 1st number: ",a)
# b=int(input( "2nd number: "))
# # print("Enter the 2nd number: ",b)
# print("sum is: ",a+b)


# 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z. 
# num=float(input("enter the number: "))
# divider=float(input("enter the divider: "))
# print("the quotient is: ",num / divider)
# print("the remainder is: ",num % divider)


# 3. Check the type of variable assigned using input () function. 
# a=input("enter anything to checck its type: ")
# t=type(a)
# print("so the type is: ",t)


# 4. Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than 
# ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80 
# a=34
# b=80
# print("a is greater than b: ",a>b)


# 5. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user. 
# a=float(input("enter a  number: "))
# b=float(input("enter another  number: "))
# print("the Average is: ",(a+b)/2)


# 6. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user. 
# a=float(input("The number is: "))
# print("The square is: ",a*a)
