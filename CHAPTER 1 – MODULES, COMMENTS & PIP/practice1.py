# 1. Write a program to print Twinkle twinkle little star poem in python.
# print("""Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
# How I wonder what you are!
# Up above the world so high,
# Like a diamond in the sky.

# When the blazing sun is gone,
# When he nothing shines upon,
# Then you show your little light,
# Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

# Then the trav'ller in the dark,
# Thanks you for your tiny spark,
# He could not see which way to go,
# If you did not twinkle so.

# In the dark blue sky you keep,
# And often thro' my curtains peep,
# For you never shut your eye,
# Till the sun is in the sky.

# 'Tis your bright and tiny spark,
# Lights the trav'ller in the dark:
# Tho' I know not what you are,
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star.""")

# from emoji import EMOJI_DATA
# for name in list(EMOJI_DATA.keys())[:10]:
#                  print(name)

# 3. Install an external module and use it to perform an operation of your interest.

# contents = os.listdir(path)

# # Print each item
