# CHAPTER 4 - PRACTICE SET 
# 1. Write a program to store seven fruits in a list entered by the user.
# a = input("Enter fruit 1: ") 
# b = input("Enter fruit 2: ") 
# c = input("Enter fruit 3: ") 
# d = input("Enter fruit 4: ") 
# e = input("Enter fruit 5: ") 
# f = input("Enter fruit 6: ") 
# g = input("Enter fruit 7: ") 

# l1 = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g]
# print("the list of the fruits are: ",l1)



# 2. Write a program to accept marks of 6 students and display them in a sorted 
# manner. 
# a = int(input("Enter the marks in physics for student no.1: "))
# b = int(input("Enter the marks in physics for student no.2: "))
# c = int(input("Enter the marks in physics for student no.3: "))
# d = int(input("Enter the marks in physics for student no.4: "))
# e = int(input("Enter the marks in physics for student no.5: "))
# f = int(input("Enter the marks in physics for student no.6: "))

# l1=[a, b, c, d, e, f]
# l1.sort()
# print("the increasing order of the sorted marks are: ",l1)




# 3. Check that a tuple type cannot be changed in python. 
# t = ( "apple", "banana", "cherry")
# t[1]= "orange"
# print(t)
# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment



# 4. Write a program to sum a list with 4 numbers. 
# a = int(input("Enter the no.1: "))
# b = int(input("Enter the no.2: "))
# c = int(input("Enter the no.3: "))
# d = int(input("Enter the no.4: "))

# sum = a + b + c + d

# print("the sum is: ", sum)




# 5. Write a program to count the number of zeros in the following tuple: 
# a = (7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9) 
# print("The number od zeros present in the tuple is:", a.count(0))
